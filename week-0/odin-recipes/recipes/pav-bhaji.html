    <p>Pav Bhaji is a popular Indian street food that originated in Mumbai. It is a flavorful and spicy mashed vegetable curry (bhaji) served with soft, butter-toasted bread rolls (pav). The dish was initially created as a quick, nutritious meal for textile mill workers but has now become a beloved comfort food across India.</p>
    
    <p>The bhaji is made by mashing boiled potatoes, peas, cauliflower, and other vegetables with a rich blend of spices, including pav bhaji masala, red chili powder, and turmeric. It is then simmered in butter to enhance its taste. The pav (bread rolls) are toasted with butter and a sprinkle of pav bhaji masala, making them soft yet crispy.</p>
    
    <p>Pav Bhaji is best enjoyed hot, garnished with fresh coriander, a squeeze of lemon, and extra butter. Itâ€™s a dish thatâ€™s bursting with flavors, offering a perfect combination of spice, tanginess, and creaminess. Whether eaten as a snack, dinner, or party dish, Pav Bhaji is always a crowd-pleaser!</p>
